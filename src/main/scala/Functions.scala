  Exercises
Write a function that computes the area of a circle given its radius.
Provide an alternate form of the function in exercise 1 that takes the radius as a String. What happens if your function is invoked with an empty String ?
Write a recursive function that prints the values from 5 to 50 by fives, without using for or while loops. Can you make it tail-recursive?
Write a function that takes a milliseconds value and returns a string describing the value in days, hours, minutes, and seconds. Whatâ€™s the optimal type for the input value?
Write a function that calculates the first value raised to the exponent of the second value. Try writing this first using math.pow, then with your own calculation. Did you implement it with variables? Is there a solution available that only uses immutable data? Did you choose a numeric type that is large enough for your uses?
Write a function that calculates the difference between a pair of 2D points (x and y) and returns the result as a point. Hint: this would be a good use for tuples (see Tuples).
Write a function that takes a 2-sized tuple and returns it with the Int value (if included) in the first position. Hint: this would be a good use for type parameters and the isInstanceOf type operation.
Write a function that takes a 3-sized tuple and returns a 6-sized tuple, with each original parameter followed by its String representation. For example, invoking the function with (true, 22.25, "yes") should return (true, "true", 22.5, "22.5", "yes", "yes"). Can you ensure that tuples of all possible types are compatible with your function? When you invoke this function, can you do so with explicit types not only in the function result but in the value that you use to store the result?
